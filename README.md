# About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Gabriel, and I'm passionate about coding and software development. 

Here's a little bit about my journey:

- 🚀 I embarked on my coding journey at the age of 15, exploring the world of programming with Minecraft using Java. This experience sparked my curiosity and laid the foundation for my love of coding.

- ⚙️ Over time, I honed my skills and leveraged them to create and manage a Minecraft server with an impressive community of over 10,000 unique users and more than 120 players online simultaneously.

- 🐍 In the past year, I've delved into the world of Python and Django. Python has become my programming language of choice, and I've spent a significant amount of time working with the Django web framework. My journey with Python and Django has been filled with exciting projects and continuous learning.

Here on my GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions. I'm constantly working on new ideas and open-source projects, so be sure to check them out and feel free to collaborate or provide feedback.

If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or simply have a chat about coding or technology please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always eager to engage with fellow developers and enthusiasts.
